\section{conclusion}

This paper proposes a fast function startup design based on the container checkpoint/restore technique. 
By restoring a containerized function instance from the checkpoint of previously executed function process, 
the time-consuming processes in the function startup phase are skipped. 
The evaluation shows that \pname the startup latency of serverless functions can be reduced by 70\% 
when compared to the default function startup method and the resource occupation of \pname is reduced 
up to 90\% compared to the default.
